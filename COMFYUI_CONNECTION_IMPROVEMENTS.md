# ComfyUI Connection Improvements

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Connection Reset Errors
**Problem**: ComfyUI was throwing `ConnectionResetError: [WinError 10054] An existing connection was forcibly closed by the remote host`

**Root Cause**: The client-side fetch requests were being terminated before ComfyUI finished cleaning up its connections.

**Solution**: Enhanced error handling and connection management:

#### Image Fetch Improvements
- Added 10-second timeout for image fetching
- Added proper error handling for failed image responses
- Graceful fallback when image fetch fails but generation succeeded

#### Polling Improvements  
- Better error classification (timeout vs network vs other errors)
- Continued polling despite connection issues
- More informative error logging with attempt numbers

### 2. Connection Stability
**Improvements Made**:
- Added proper `AbortSignal` timeouts to all fetch requests
- Implemented graceful error recovery for network issues
- Enhanced logging to distinguish between different error types

## Technical Details

### Enhanced Error Handling
```typescript
try {
  const imageResponse = await fetch(imageUrl, {
    signal: AbortSignal.timeout(10000) // 10 second timeout
  })
  
  if (!imageResponse.ok) {
    throw new Error(`Failed to fetch image: ${imageResponse.status}`)
  }
  
  // Process image...
} catch (imageError) {
  console.log('‚ö†Ô∏è Error fetching generated image:', imageError)
  return createComfyUIFallback(prompt, model, 'Generated but failed to fetch image')
}
```

### Improved Polling Logic
```typescript
} catch (pollError) {
  const errorMessage = pollError instanceof Error ? pollError.message : String(pollError)
  console.log(`‚ö†Ô∏è Error polling ComfyUI (attempt ${attempts + 1}):`, errorMessage)
  
  // Don't immediately fail on connection errors, keep trying
  if (pollError instanceof Error) {
    if (pollError.name === 'AbortError' || errorMessage.includes('timeout')) {
      console.log('üîÑ Continuing polling despite timeout...')
    } else if (errorMessage.includes('connection') || errorMessage.includes('network')) {
      console.log('üîÑ Network issue, continuing polling...')
    }
  }
}
```

## Expected Behavior

### Before Improvements
- Connection reset errors would appear in ComfyUI console
- Images might fail to be retrieved despite successful generation
- Less informative error messages

### After Improvements  
- Connection errors are handled gracefully
- Images are retrieved with proper timeout and error handling
- Detailed logging helps identify specific issues
- Fallback generation when needed

## Monitoring

Watch for these log messages to confirm proper operation:

### Success Indicators
- `‚úÖ Successfully generated image with ComfyUI`
- `üìÅ Image size: X bytes`
- `üîß Applying advanced settings: {...}`

### Expected Recovery Messages
- `üîÑ Continuing polling despite timeout...`
- `üîÑ Network issue, continuing polling...`
- `‚ö†Ô∏è Error fetching generated image:` (with fallback)

### Warning Signs
- Repeated timeout errors
- Failed image fetch without fallback
- ComfyUI server not responding

## Additional Improvements

1. **Consistent Results**: Added seed-based consistency option
2. **Advanced Settings**: Now properly applied to generation
3. **Enhanced Prompts**: Better subject preservation and drift prevention
4. **Robust Error Recovery**: Multiple layers of fallback handling

## Usage Recommendations

1. **For Stable Generation**: Enable "Consistent Results" in Advanced Settings
2. **For Troubleshooting**: Monitor console logs for error patterns
3. **For Performance**: Ensure ComfyUI server is running locally on port 8188
4. **For Quality**: Use appropriate advanced settings (steps, CFG, etc.)
