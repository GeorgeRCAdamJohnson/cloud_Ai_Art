## 🏗️ **Exercise 1: Understanding Node Connections**

### **Basic Connection Patterns**
```yaml
Exercise 1A: Simple Text-to-Image
Goal: Understand data flow through nodes

Workflow:
CheckpointLoaderSimple → MODEL, CLIP, VAE
CLIPTextEncode (positive) → CONDITIONING  
CLIPTextEncode (negative) → CONDITIONING
EmptyLatentImage → LATENT
KSampler → LATENT (processed)
VAEDecode → IMAGE

Practice:
1. Build this workflow in ComfyUI
2. Generate a simple image
3. Observe data types flowing between nodes
4. Note VRAM usage at each step
```

### **Data Type Understanding**
```python
# ComfyUI Data Types Explained:

IMAGE: 
  - Format: [batch, height, width, channels]
  - Range: 0.0 to 1.0 (float)
  - Channels: RGB (3) or RGBA (4)

LATENT:
  - Format: [batch, channels, height/8, width/8] 
  - Range: Various (model-dependent)
  - Purpose: Compressed representation for processing

CONDITIONING:
  - Format: Complex tensor with attention weights
  - Purpose: Text embeddings for guidance
  - Size: Depends on prompt length and model

MODEL:
  - Format: Neural network weights
  - Size: 2-7GB depending on model type
  - Purpose: Core diffusion processing
```

## 🎨 **Exercise 2: Character Creation Pipeline**

### **Kid-Friendly Character Workflow**
```yaml
Exercise 2A: Safe Character Generation
Goal: Build a complete safety-focused pipeline

Required Nodes:
- CheckpointLoaderSimple (SDXL model)
- CLIPTextEncode (positive prompt)
- CLIPTextEncode (negative prompt with safety terms)
- KSampler (conservative settings)
- VAEDecode
- BRIA Background Removal (if installed)
- SaveImage

Step-by-Step Build:
1. Load SDXL model
2. Create positive prompt: "cute cartoon cat character, friendly smile, colorful, child-friendly style"
3. Create negative prompt: "scary, dark, inappropriate, realistic, photographic"
4. Set KSampler parameters:
   - Steps: 25
   - CFG: 7
   - Sampler: euler_a
   - Scheduler: normal
5. Generate 512x512 image
6. Remove background
7. Save result

Expected Result: Clean character asset ready for web use
Time Estimate: 2-5 minutes on RTX 3050
```

### **Advanced Character Consistency**
```yaml
Exercise 2B: Character Variations
Goal: Generate multiple poses of same character

Technique: Seed Control + Prompt Variations
1. Generate base character with fixed seed
2. Create variations:
   - "cute cartoon cat sitting"
   - "cute cartoon cat jumping" 
   - "cute cartoon cat waving"
3. Use same seed for consistency
4. Adjust denoising strength (0.3-0.7)
5. Compare results for consistency

Learning: How seed affects character consistency
```

2. Set up batch processing
3. Create base prompt template: "simple [ICON_TYPE] icon, minimalist, flat design, blue and white, transparent background"
4. Generate multiple variations
5. Use BRIA for background removal
6. Resize to different dimensions

Pro Tip: Use ComfyUI's batch processing to generate all sizes simultaneously
```

### **Button State Generation**
```yaml

Hover: "blue button with rounded corners, slight glow, elevated"
Active: "blue button with rounded corners, pressed down, darker"
Disabled: "gray button with rounded corners, faded, inactive"

Implementation:
1. Generate each state separately
2. Ensure consistent dimensions
3. Export as sprite sheet or individual files

## ⚡ **Exercise 5: Performance Optimization**

### **Memory Management Workshop**
```yaml
Exercise 5A: VRAM Monitoring
Goal: Understand and optimize memory usage

Tools Needed:
- nvidia-smi (command line)
- Task Manager GPU monitoring
- ComfyUI built-in memory display

Monitoring Exercise:
1. Start with empty ComfyUI - record base VRAM
2. Load SDXL model - record model loading impact
3. Generate 512x512 image - record generation peak
4. Generate 1024x1024 image - record scaling impact
5. Load additional LoRA - record addon impact

Create Memory Usage Chart:
Operation          | VRAM Usage | Notes
Base ComfyUI       | ~800MB     | Interface only
SDXL Model Load    | ~2.8GB     | Model in VRAM
512x512 Generation | ~3.5GB     | Peak during sampling
1024x1024 Generation| ~4.8GB    | Higher resolution impact
+LoRA Addition     | ~5.2GB     | Additional model weights
DANGER ZONE        | >5.5GB     | Risk of OOM errors
```

### **Batch Processing Optimization**
```yaml
Exercise 5B: Efficient Batch Workflows
Goal: Process multiple assets without OOM errors

Smart Batching Strategy:
1. Process assets by complexity (simple → complex)
2. Clear VRAM between different model types
3. Use CPU offloading for non-critical operations
4. Monitor and adjust batch sizes dynamically

Implementation:
def process_batch(assets, max_vram=5500):
    for asset in assets:
        estimated_usage = estimate_vram(asset)
        current_usage = get_vram_usage()
        
        if current_usage + estimated_usage > max_vram:
            clear_vram()
            
        process_asset(asset)
        
    return results
```
