## 🚀 Recommended Next Steps

### 1. **Update Import Paths**
Some scripts may need updated file paths after the reorganization.

### 2. **NPM Scripts**
Add convenience scripts to package.json:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test:all": "node tests/test-comfyui-connection.js",
    "optimize": "node scripts/model-workflow-optimizer.js",
    "docs": "open docs/OPTIMIZATION_SUMMARY.md"
  }
}
```

### 3. **IDE Configuration**  
Update VS Code workspace settings to exclude result folders from search.

### 4. **Documentation Index**
Consider creating docs/index.md as a documentation hub.

### 5. **Automation**
Set up automated testing workflows using the organized test structure.
