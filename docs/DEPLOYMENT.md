# Netlify Deployment Guide for Cloud AI Art

## Project Details
- **Project URL**: https://app.netlify.com/projects/cloudaiart
- **Project ID**: 22fe0741-d224-44ea-bed3-88a0be2ddaca
- **Site Name**: cloudaiart
- **Expected Live URL**: https://cloudaiart.netlify.app

## ‚úÖ Configuration Completed
Your project is now configured with:

### Build Settings
- **Build Command**: `npm run build`
- **Publish Directory**: `.next`
- **Node Version**: 18
- **Next.js Plugin**: Enabled for optimal performance

### API Routes
- Configured for Netlify Functions
- Serverless deployment ready
- CORS headers configured

### Security
- CSP headers configured
- XSS protection enabled
- Frame options secured

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### 1. Environment Variables

#### For Netlify Dashboard:
In your Netlify dashboard, add:
```
HUGGINGFACE_API_TOKEN = [Your Hugging Face API token here]
```

#### For GitHub Actions (Already Configured):
‚úÖ You've already added these GitHub Secrets:
- `HUGGINGFACEALL` - Full access token (recommended for deployment)
- `HUGGINGFACEREAD` - Read-only access token  
- `HUGGINGFACEWRITE` - Write access token

**Get your tokens from**: https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens

#### Token Priority:
The application will use tokens in this order:
1. `HUGGINGFACE_API_TOKEN` (for local development)
2. `HUGGINGFACEALL` (for GitHub Actions and production)
3. `HUGGINGFACEWRITE` (fallback)

### 2. Deploy Settings
- **Repository**: GeorgeRCAdamJohnson/cloud_Ai_Art
- **Branch**: main
- **Build Command**: npm run build
- **Publish Directory**: .next

### 3. Expected Features After Deployment
‚úÖ AI Sprite Generation (Hugging Face API)
‚úÖ Responsive UI with Tailwind CSS
‚úÖ API Routes as Serverless Functions
‚úÖ Global CDN Distribution
‚úÖ Automatic HTTPS

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Storage Limitation
- Netlify is stateless
- Generated images won't persist between deployments
- Images are temporary (session-based only)

### For Persistent Storage (Future Enhancement)
Consider integrating:
- **Cloudinary** for image hosting
- **Supabase** for database storage
- **AWS S3** for file storage

## üîç Troubleshooting

### If Build Fails
1. Check Node version is 18
2. Verify environment variables are set
3. Ensure all dependencies are in package.json

### If API Routes Don't Work
1. Check function logs in Netlify dashboard
2. Verify HUGGINGFACE_API_TOKEN is set
3. Check CORS configuration

## üìä Performance Optimizations
- Static asset caching enabled
- Image optimization configured
- CDN distribution active
- Function cold start minimized
